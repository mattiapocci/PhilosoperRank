# PhilosopherRank
WIR project for 2020 course at MSC in Engineering in Computer Science, Sapienza University, Rome.

In this project we reproduce the results of [this](http://www.mecs-press.org/ijisa/ijisa-v7-n12/IJISA-V7-N12-5.pdf) paper where the author wanted to apply Google PageRank to Wikipedia guitarists articles to rank them based on influence they had on each other.

Our approach was to apply the same tecniques to philosopher articles, and in the making we decided to introduce some new methods in order to improve the final results. Those techniques can be found [here](PhilosopherRank.pdf).
