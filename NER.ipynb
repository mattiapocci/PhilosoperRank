            "Isaeva states Shankara 's influence included reforming Hinduism , founding monasteries , edifying disciples , disputing opponents and engaging in philosophic activity that , in the eyes of Indian tradition , help revive `` the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings '' and Vedanta thought.Prior to Shankara , views similar to his already existed , but did not occupy a dominant position within the Vedanta .\n",
            "According to Nakamura , it was only after Shankara that `` the theologians of the various sects of Hinduism utilized Vedanta philosophy to a greater or lesser degree to form the basis of their doctrines , '' whereby `` its theoretical influence upon the whole of Indian society became final and definitive . ''\n",
            "=== Critical assessment === Some scholars doubt Shankara 's early influence in India .\n",
            "While both share core premises , states Isaeva , they differ in several ways , with Mandana Misra holding Vedic knowledge as an absolute and end in itself , while Shankara holds Vedic knowledge and all religious rites as subsidiary and means to the human longing for `` liberation , freedom and moksha '' .Several scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later , particularly during the era of Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India .\n",
            "Vidyaranya was a minister in Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support , and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values , and helped spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara 's Vedanta philosophies .\n",

            "His influence is also evident in De philosophia mundi by William of Conches , Hugh of Saint Victor , and Isaac of Stella 's Letters to Alcher on the Soul .\n",

            "== Reception and influence == While Althusser 's writings were born of an intervention against reformist and ecumenical tendencies within Marxist theory , the eclecticism of his influences reflected a move away from the intellectual isolation of the Stalin era , in that he drew as much from pre-Marxist systems of thought and contemporary schools such as structuralism , philosophy of science and psychoanalysis as he did from thinkers in the Marxist tradition .\n",

A. Cohen ; the interest in structure and agency sparked by Althusser was to play a role in Anthony Giddens 's theory of structuration ; Althusser was vehemently attacked by British historian E. P.

            "While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax , he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and , indeed , he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him .\n",

            "Andreae 's island also depicts a great advancement in technology , with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population 's needs—which shows great resemblance to Bacon 's scientific methods and purposes.While rejecting occult conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian , intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon 's scientific and religious writing .\n",
            "Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity , populated by spirits , and argues Bacon 's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.The Rosicrucian organization AMORC claims that Bacon was the `` Imperator '' ( leader ) of the Rosicrucian Order in both England and the European continent , and would have directed it during his lifetime.Bacon 's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors , and on groups that have utilized his writings in their own belief systems .\n",
            "In particular , Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste : his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste 's lead , as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.Bacon noted of William of Sherwood that `` nobody was greater in philosophy than he '' ; praised Peter of Maricourt ( the author of `` A Letter on Magnetism '' ) and John of London as `` perfect '' mathematicians ; Campanus of Novara ( the author of works on astronomy , astrology , and the calendar ) and a Master Nicholas as `` good '' ; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures .\n",
            "With regard to religion 's influence on Bacon 's philosophy , Charles Sanders Peirce noted , `` To Roger Bacon , ... the schoolmen 's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth ...

            "The completed work was to have extended to 14 volumes ; its chief ideas are : That , owing partly to the want of ability in historians , and partly to the complexity of social phenomena , extremely little had as yet been done towards discovering the principles that govern the character and destiny of nations , or , in other words , towards establishing a science of history ; That , while the theological dogma of predestination is a barren hypothesis beyond the province of knowledge , and the metaphysical dogma of free will rests on an erroneous belief in the infallibility of consciousness , it is proved by science , and especially by statistics , that human actions are governed by laws as fixed and regular as those that rule in the physical world ; That climate , soil , food , and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress : the first three indirectly , through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth , and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought , the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible , the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble ; That the great division between European and non-European civilization turns on the fact that in Europe man is stronger than nature , and that elsewhere nature is stronger than man , the consequence of which is that in Europe alone has man subdued nature to his service ; That the advance of European civilization is characterized by a continually diminishing influence of physical laws , and a continually increasing influence of mental laws ; That the mental laws that regulate the progress of society can not be discovered by the metaphysical method , that is , by the introspective study of the individual mind , but only by such a comprehensive survey of facts as enable us to eliminate disturbances , that is , by the method of averages ; That human progress has been due , not to moral agencies , which are stationary , and which balance one another in such a manner that their influence is unfelt over any long period , but to intellectual activity , which has been constantly varying and advancing : `` The actions of individuals are greatly affected by their moral feelings and passions ; but these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other individuals , are balanced by them , so that their effect is , in the great average of human affairs , nowhere to be seen , and the total actions of mankind , considered as a whole , are left to be regulated by the total knowledge of which mankind is possessed '' ; That individual efforts are insignificant in the great mass of human affairs , and that great men , although they exist , and must `` at present '' be looked upon as disturbing forces , are merely the creatures of the age to which they belong ; That religion , literature and government are , at the best , the products and not the causes of civilization ; That the progress of civilization varies directly as `` scepticism '' , the disposition to doubt and to investigate , and inversely as `` credulity '' or `` the protective spirit '' , a disposition to maintain , without examination , established beliefs and practices .\n",
            "It is easy for one to make a great many very superficial objections to Mr. BUCKLE 's mode of treating history ... , but the more one comes up with the grandeur of his method , the less disposition there will be to make such objections ... . His influence on the thought of the present age can not but be enormous ; and if he gives us no more than we already have in the two volumes of the magnum opus , he will still be classed among the fathers and founders of the Science of History .

            "Michael Kelly , in the preface to his 1910 book Kant 's Ethics and Schopenhauer 's Criticism , stated : `` Of Kant it may be said that what is good and true in his philosophy would have been buried with him , were it not for Schopenhauer ... . '' With the success and wide influence of Hegel 's writings , Kant 's influence began to wane , though there was in Germany a movement that hailed a return to Kant in the 1860s , beginning with the publication of Kant und die Epigonen in 1865 by Otto Liebmann .\n",

            "Widely regarded as the most influential Kant scholar in China , Mou 's rigorous critique of Kant ’ s philosophy—having translated all three of Kant ’ s critiques—served as an ardent attempt to reconcile Chinese and Western philosophy whilst increasing pressure to westernize in China.Kant 's influence also has extended to the social , behavioral , and physical sciences , as in the sociology of Max Weber , the psychology of Jean Piaget , and the linguistics of Noam Chomsky .\n",
            "Kant 's work on mathematics and synthetic a priori knowledge is also cited by theoretical physicist Albert Einstein as an early influence on his intellectual development , which he later criticised heavily and rejected .\n",

            "Another part of Kelsen 's practical legacy , as he has recorded , was the influence that his writings from the 1930s and early 1940s had upon the extensive and unprecedented prosecution of political leaders and military leaders at the end of WWII at Nuremberg and Tokyo , producing convictions in more than one thousand war crimes cases .\n",
            "It is stated that in the English-speaking world , and notably the `` Oxford school '' of jurisprudence '' , Kelsen 's influence can be seen in H. L. A. Hart , Julie Dickson , John Gardner , Leslie Green , Jim Harris , Tony Honoré , Joseph Raz and Richard Tur , and `` in the backhanded compliment of strenuous criticism , also in the work of John Finnis '' .\n",
            "Kelsen explicitly defined positive law to deal with the many ambiguities he associated with the use of natural law in his time , along with the negative influence which it had upon the reception of what was meant even by positive law in contexts apparently removed from the domain of influence normally associated with natural law .\n",
            "The science of law and legal science were key methodological distinctions which were of high importance to Kelsen in the development of the pure theory of law and the general project of removing ambiguous ideological elements from having undue influence on the development of modern twentieth century law .\n",

            "Keynes 's influence started to wane in the 1970s , partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade , and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists , who disputed the ability of government to favorably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy .\n",
            "Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes .\n",
            "However , Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts , his published works and by serving on government committees ; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant .\n",
            "The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments , and according to Robert Skidelsky , helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas , though it had little immediate practical influence .\n",
            "However , according to Skidelsky , the consensus is that Keynes 's efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.Keynes 's magnum opus , The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money was published in 1936 .\n",
            "Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s , when Keynes 's influence was at its peak , appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.In late 1965 Time magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman ( later echoed by U.S. President Richard Nixon ) , `` We are all Keynesians now '' .\n",
            "The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing , and reported that `` Washington 's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes 's central theme : the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency , but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government .

            "Keynes had written against the folly of allowing `` decadent and selfish '' speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I .\n",
            "So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics – by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy .\n",
            "However , many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes , and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism , after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making .\n",
            "Macroeconomic policy , Friedman argues , can reliably influence only the nominal .\n",
            "On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends , most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom , explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria .\n",
            "However , in more recent years , since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 , with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s , and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances , these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes ' insights have slipped from view .\n",
            "Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.Keynes was a proponent of eugenics .\n",
            "His writings , printed posthumously by his friends and disciples , exerted a profound influence on the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian lay philosophers , such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Konstantin Pobedonostsev , and Vladimir Solovyov .\n",
