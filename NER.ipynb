            "Some scholars and anti-Catholic polemicists argue that its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint Augustine of Hippo , who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism and whose writing continues to be enormously influential among Catholic and Protestant theologians .\n",
            "Secularism , or religious freedom , is usually considered to go both ways : the state should not compel the people to follow ( or not follow ) a religion , and likewise religious doctrines should not influence the actions of the state .\n",
            "It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law , environmental sociology , ecotheology , ecological economics , ecology and environmental geography .\n",
            "However , his works and philosophy suggest greater overlap with Vaishnavism , influence of Yoga school of Hinduism , but most distinctly his Advaitin convictions with a monistic view of spirituality .\n",
            "Buddhism in particular had emerged as a powerful influence in India 's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE .\n",
            "Isaeva states Shankara 's influence included reforming Hinduism , founding monasteries , edifying disciples , disputing opponents and engaging in philosophic activity that , in the eyes of Indian tradition , help revive `` the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings '' and Vedanta thought.Prior to Shankara , views similar to his already existed , but did not occupy a dominant position within the Vedanta .\n",
            "According to Nakamura , it was only after Shankara that `` the theologians of the various sects of Hinduism utilized Vedanta philosophy to a greater or lesser degree to form the basis of their doctrines , '' whereby `` its theoretical influence upon the whole of Indian society became final and definitive . ''\n",
            "=== Critical assessment === Some scholars doubt Shankara 's early influence in India .\n",
            "While both share core premises , states Isaeva , they differ in several ways , with Mandana Misra holding Vedic knowledge as an absolute and end in itself , while Shankara holds Vedic knowledge and all religious rites as subsidiary and means to the human longing for `` liberation , freedom and moksha '' .Several scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later , particularly during the era of Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India .\n",
            "Vidyaranya was a minister in Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support , and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values , and helped spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara 's Vedanta philosophies .\n",
            "Vidyaranya also helped establish monasteries ( mathas ) to expand the cultural influence of Shankara .\n",
            "Nevertheless , contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Shaiva communities than among Vaisnava communities .\n",
            "The greatest influence of the gurus of the advaita tradition has been among followers of the Smartha Tradition , who integrate the domestic Vedic ritual with devotional aspects of Hinduism.According to Nakamura , these mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara , which was `` due to institutional factors '' .\n",
            "The mathas which he built exist until today , and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara , `` while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time '' .The table below gives an overview of the four Amnaya Mathas founded by Shankara , and their details .\n",

            "=== Later influence === Abelard was an enormous influence on his contemporaries and the course of medieval philosophical thought , but he has been known in modern times mainly for his connection with Héloïse .\n",
            "The fascinating hypothesis of Abaelard 's influence on Menasseh Ben Israel and Spinoza has been developed by Robert Menasse and first published in his essay `` Enlightenment as Harmonious Strategy '' edited by Versopolis in 2018 .\n",

            "He wrote a treatise on the use of the abacus called Regulae Abaci , which was likely written very early in his career because it shows no trace of Arab influence .\n",
            "== Influence == When Adelard 's influence on the study of philosophy is considered , it is clear that his ideas most notably manifested in the later works of Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon .\n",
            "His influence is also evident in De philosophia mundi by William of Conches , Hugh of Saint Victor , and Isaac of Stella 's Letters to Alcher on the Soul .\n",
            "After the conclusion of the war , his influence increased greatly .\n",
            "His death was a temporary blow to the influence of his ideas , although a number of them were subsequently taken up by neo-Freudians .\n",
            "=== On birth order === Adler often emphasized one 's birth order as having an influence on the style of life and the strengths and weaknesses in one 's psychological make up .\n",
            "Hence , Adlerians spend time therapeutically mapping the influence that siblings ( or lack thereof ) had on the psychology of their clients .\n",
            "The idiographic approach entails an excavation of the phenomenology of one 's birth order position for likely influence on the subject 's Style of Life .\n",
            "Adler follows this pronouncement with a defense of metaphysics : I see no reason to be afraid of metaphysics ; it has had a great influence on human life and development .\n",
            "Friends attempted to dissuade him from accepting the archduke 's patronage ; they feared that the archduke 's influence would undermine his philosophical ideals .\n",
            "== Legacy and influence == De inventione dialectica was influential in creating a place for logic in rhetorical studies , and was of significance in the education of early humanists .\n",
            "Agricola 's real legacy was his personal influence over others .\n",
            "It is likely that Agrippa 's interest in the occult came from this Albertist influence .\n",
            "The book was a major influence on such later magical thinkers as Giordano Bruno and John Dee , but was ill-understood after the decline of the Occult Renaissance concomitant with the scientific revolution .\n",
            "Among these was categorial grammar , a highly flexible framework for the analysis of natural language syntax and ( indirectly ) semantics that remains a major influence on work in formal linguistics .\n",
            "Albert 's work in logic also shows strong influence by William of Ockham , whose commentaries on the logica vetus ( i. e. on Porphyry , and Aristotle 's Categoriae and De interpretatione ) were made the subject of a series of works called Quaestiones by Albert .\n",
            "Albert is also mentioned , along with Agrippa and Paracelsus , in Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , in which his writings influence a young Victor Frankenstein .\n",
            "Two of his tutors were the philosopher T. H. Green and the Latinist Henry Nettleship , who exercised a great influence on his early work .\n",
            "He did not always give the impression that he was much interested in teaching , yet he was a great teacher whose influence was widespread .\n",
            "He is cited as an influence on John Milton , Geoffrey Chaucer and Alfred Tennyson , among many others .\n",
            "But the city 's government had treated the Pope 's ambassadors badly a few weeks before , seeking independence from papal influence .\n",
            "He survived two assassination attempts in Egypt and Lebanon and suffered imprisonment in Egypt under instigation from the Yemeni government , because of his great influence on Yemeni students who , because of their frequent meetings with him , were deeply influenced by his thoughts .\n",
            "Such influence was perceived by the Yemeni government as negative and not suitable to Islam .\n",
            "These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory , and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties , as well as the problem of the `` cult of personality '' and of ideology .\n",
            "This combination may have led him to adopt German Idealism and Hegelian thought , as did Martin 's influence and a renewed interest on Hegel in the 1930s and 1940s in France .\n",
            "The objective of this endeavour was to identify Feuerbach 's influence on Marx early writings , contrasting it with the absence of his thought on Marx 's mature works .\n",
            "Even if he was not publicly censured nor expelled from the PCF , as were 600 Maoist students , the support of Garaudy resulted in a further reduction of Althusser 's influence in the party.Still in 1966 , Althusser published in the Cahiers pour l'Analyse the article `` On the 'Social Contract ' '' ( `` Sur le 'Contrat Social ' '' ) , a course about Rousseau he had given at the ENS , and `` Cremonini , Painter of the Abstract '' ( `` Cremonini , peintre de l'abstrait '' ) about Italian painter Leonardo Cremonini .\n",
            "He also started a rereading of Machiavelli that would influence his later work ; he worked between 1975–1976 on `` Machiavel et nous '' ( `` Machiavelli and Us '' ) , a draft , only published posthumously , based on a 1972 lecture , and also wrote for the National Foundation of Political Science a piece titled `` Machiavelli 's Solitude '' ( `` Solitude de Machiavel '' , 1977 ) .\n",
            "The philosopher described his mother as a `` castrating mother '' ( a term from psychoanalysis ) , who , under the influence of her phobias , established a strict regime of social and sexual `` hygiene '' for Althusser and his sister Georgette .\n",
            "Also , Althusser focused on describing family circumstances , not considering , for example , the influence of ENS on his personality .\n",
            "Althusser 's understanding of contradiction in terms of the dialectic attempts to rid Marxism of the influence and vestiges of Hegelian ( idealist ) dialectics , and is a component part of his general anti-humanist position .\n",
            "== Reception and influence == While Althusser 's writings were born of an intervention against reformist and ecumenical tendencies within Marxist theory , the eclecticism of his influences reflected a move away from the intellectual isolation of the Stalin era , in that he drew as much from pre-Marxist systems of thought and contemporary schools such as structuralism , philosophy of science and psychoanalysis as he did from thinkers in the Marxist tradition .\n",
            "`` Althusser has had broad influence in the areas of Marxist philosophy and post-structuralism : interpellation has been popularized and adapted by the feminist philosopher and critic Judith Butler , and elaborated further by Göran Therborn ; the concept of ideological state apparatuses has been of interest to Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek ; the attempt to view history as a process without a subject garnered sympathy from Jacques Derrida ; historical materialism was defended as a coherent doctrine from the standpoint of analytic philosophy by G. A. Cohen ; the interest in structure and agency sparked by Althusser was to play a role in Anthony Giddens 's theory of structuration ; Althusser was vehemently attacked by British historian E. P. Thompson in his book The Poverty of Theory.Althusser 's influence is also seen in the work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick , who have interpreted that Marx 's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones .\n",
            "== Legacy == Since his death , the reassessment of Althusser 's work and influence has been ongoing .\n",
            "The general title was Politique et philosophie dans l'oeuvre de Louis Althusser , the proceedings of which were published in 1993.In retrospect , Althusser 's continuing importance and influence can be seen through his students .\n",
            "This influence continues to guide some of today 's most significant and provocative philosophical work , as many of these same students became eminent intellectuals in the 1960s , 1970s , 1980s and 1990s : Alain Badiou , Étienne Balibar and Jacques Rancière in philosophy , Pierre Macherey in literary criticism and Nicos Poulantzas in sociology .\n",
            "He had notable influence on Augustine of Hippo ( 354-430 ) .\n",
            "=== Attitude towards pagans === Under his influence , emperors Gratian , Valentinian II and Theodosius I carried on a persecution of paganism ; Theodosius issued the 391 `` Theodosian decrees , '' which with increasing intensity outlawed pagan practices.The Altar of Victory was removed by Gratian .\n",
            "It is alleged , too , that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support , he was admonished in a dream to search for , and found under the pavement of the church , the remains of two martyrs , Gervasius and Protasius .\n",
            "=== Mariology === The theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence Popes Damasus , Siricius and Leo XIII .\n",
            "He was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism , although little is known about his own philosophical views .\n",
            "However , we are told by Longinus that Ammonius wrote nothing , and if Ammonius was the principal influence on Plotinus , then it is unlikely that Ammonius would have been a Christian .\n",
            "== Biography == Anaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of Clazomenae .\n",
            "Heidegger 's lecture is , in turn , an important influence on the French philosopher Jacques Derrida .\n",
            "By the end of the Milesian philosophy era , there were many questions left unanswered ; this sparked the stimulation of Pre-socratic thought to continue through many other notable philosophers such as Pythagoras , Parmenides , Heraclitus , and Democritus.Anaximenes greatest influence is not from his theories of matter , but instead it is from how he thought about these ideas .\n",

''\n",
            "Aristotle 's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna 's linking of Galen 's medical writings with Aristotle 's philosophical writings in the Canon of Medicine ( along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge ) significantly increased Avicenna 's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine .\n",
            "His influence following translation of the Canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities , princeps medicorum ( `` prince of physicians '' ) .\n",

            "His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers .\n",
            "On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon Baron Verulam , of Verulam , in the Peerage of England ; he then became known as Francis , Lord Verulam.Bacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament , and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage , as Viscount St Alban , on 27 January 1621 .\n",
            "While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax , he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and , indeed , he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him .\n",
            "One of his biographers , the historian William Hepworth Dixon , states : `` Bacon 's influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train , sends a telegram , follows a steam plough , sits in an easy chair , crosses the channel or the Atlantic , eats a good dinner , enjoys a beautiful garden , or undergoes a painless surgical operation , owes him something .\n",
            "Andreae 's island also depicts a great advancement in technology , with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population 's needs—which shows great resemblance to Bacon 's scientific methods and purposes.While rejecting occult conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian , intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon 's scientific and religious writing .\n",
            "Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity , populated by spirits , and argues Bacon 's views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.The Rosicrucian organization AMORC claims that Bacon was the `` Imperator '' ( leader ) of the Rosicrucian Order in both England and the European continent , and would have directed it during his lifetime.Bacon 's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors , and on groups that have utilized his writings in their own belief systems .\n",
            "In particular , Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste : his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste 's lead , as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.Bacon noted of William of Sherwood that `` nobody was greater in philosophy than he '' ; praised Peter of Maricourt ( the author of `` A Letter on Magnetism '' ) and John of London as `` perfect '' mathematicians ; Campanus of Novara ( the author of works on astronomy , astrology , and the calendar ) and a Master Nicholas as `` good '' ; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures .\n",
            "With regard to religion 's influence on Bacon 's philosophy , Charles Sanders Peirce noted , `` To Roger Bacon , ... the schoolmen 's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth ... [ but ] Of all kinds of experience , the best , he thought , was interior illumination , which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover , such as the transubstantiation of bread .\n",
            "In 1836 he entered Marischal College where he came under the influence of Professor of Mathematics John Cruickshank , Professor of Chemistry Thomas Clark and Professor of Natural Philosophy William Knight .\n",
            "=== Psychology === Although his influence as a logician and linguist in grammar and rhetoric was considerable , his reputation rests on his works in psychology .\n",
            "=== Influence === He is known today for his interest in a wide variety of subjects , ideas , vocabularies , and periods , as well as his use of authorial disguises , and for his influence ( alongside György Lukács ) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre .\n",
            "However , his influence on such groups has , somewhat paradoxically , resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin 's work .\n",
            "Bakhtin 's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research , and `` dialogism represents a methodological turn towards the messy reality of communication , in all its many language forms. ” In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account .\n",
            "Bakunin 's prestige as an activist also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe , gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe .\n",
            "In 1868 , Bakunin joined the International Working Men 's Association , leading an anarchist faction to rapidly grow in influence .\n",
            "Bakunin continues to influence anarchists such as Noam Chomsky .\n",
            "His biographer Mark Leier wrote that , `` Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers , ranging from Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta to the Wobblies and Spanish anarchists in the Civil War to Herbert Marcuse , E.P .\n",
            "Bakunin tired of his job as a commercial traveller , but thanks to Muravyov 's influence , was able to keep his sinecure ( worth 2,000 roubles a year ) without having to perform any duties .\n",
            "=== Relocation to Italy and influence in Spain === Having re-entered Western Europe , Bakunin immediately immersed himself in the revolutionary movement .\n",
            "Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any `` enlightened elite '' must only exert influence by remaining `` invisible ... not imposed on anyone ... [ and ] deprived of all official rights and significance '' .\n",
            "God and the State was translated multiple times by other anarchists , such as Benjamin Tucker , Marie Le Compte and Emma Goldman ; and Bakunin continues to influence modern-day anarchists , such as Noam Chomsky .\n",

            "It is easy for one to make a great many very superficial objections to Mr. BUCKLE 's mode of treating history ... , but the more one comes up with the grandeur of his method , the less disposition there will be to make such objections ... . His influence on the thought of the present age can not but be enormous ; and if he gives us no more than we already have in the two volumes of the magnum opus , he will still be classed among the fathers and founders of the Science of History .

'' With the success and wide influence of Hegel 's writings , Kant 's influence began to wane , though there was in Germany a movement that hailed a return to Kant in the 1860s , beginning with the publication of Kant und die Epigonen in 1865 by Otto Liebmann .\n",

            "Widely regarded as the most influential Kant scholar in China , Mou 's rigorous critique of Kant ’ s philosophy—having translated all three of Kant ’ s critiques—served as an ardent attempt to reconcile Chinese and Western philosophy whilst increasing pressure to westernize in China.Kant 's influence also has extended to the social , behavioral , and physical sciences , as in the sociology of Max Weber , the psychology of Jean Piaget , and the linguistics of Noam Chomsky .\n",
            "Kant 's work on mathematics and synthetic a priori knowledge is also cited by theoretical physicist Albert Einstein as an early influence on his intellectual development , which he later criticised heavily and rejected .\n",

Hart , Julie Dickson , John Gardner , Leslie Green , Jim Harris , Tony Honoré , Joseph Raz and Richard Tur , and `` in the backhanded compliment of strenuous criticism , also in the work of John Finnis '' .\n",
            "Kelsen explicitly defined positive law to deal with the many ambiguities he associated with the use of natural law in his time , along with the negative influence which it had upon the reception of what was meant even by positive law in contexts apparently removed from the domain of influence normally associated with natural law .\n",
            "The science of law and legal science were key methodological distinctions which were of high importance to Kelsen in the development of the pure theory of law and the general project of removing ambiguous ideological elements from having undue influence on the development of modern twentieth century law .\n",

            "Keynes 's influence started to wane in the 1970s , partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade , and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists , who disputed the ability of government to favorably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy .\n",
            "Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes .\n",

            "The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments , and according to Robert Skidelsky , helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas , though it had little immediate practical influence .\n",
            "However , according to Skidelsky , the consensus is that Keynes 's efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.Keynes 's magnum opus , The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money was published in 1936 .\n",
            "Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s , when Keynes 's influence was at its peak , appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.In late 1965 Time magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman ( later echoed by U.S. President Richard Nixon ) , `` We are all Keynesians now '' .\n",
            "The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing , and reported that `` Washington 's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes 's central theme : the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency , but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government .

            "However , many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes , and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism , after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making .\n",
            "Macroeconomic policy , Friedman argues , can reliably influence only the nominal .\n",
            "On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends , most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom , explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria .\n",
            "However , in more recent years , since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 , with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s , and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances , these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes ' insights have slipped from view .\n",
